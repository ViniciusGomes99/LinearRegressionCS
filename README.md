# Brazilian CSGO Platform Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a dataset from a Brazilian CSGO platform. The goal is to derive insights from player statistics using data visualization techniques and linear regression models.

## Usage
1. Load the dataset (ensure it's in the same format as the provided dataset).
2. Perform data preprocessing.
3. Run the Python scripts for data analysis and visualization.
4. Analyze the results from the linear regression model.

## Data Analysis and Visualization
- The data includes player statistics like kills, assists, deaths, headshots, and damage.
- Correlation analysis and heatmaps are used to understand relationships between variables.
- Regression plots help visualize trends and patterns in the data.
- A histogram is used to analyze the distribution of deaths per match.

## Linear Regression Model
- The project implements a linear regression model to predict player performance based on selected features.
- The model's effectiveness is evaluated using its predictions versus actual data.

## Results and Discussion
- The outcome of the linear regression model is discussed.
- Insights gained from data analysis and visualization are elaborated.
